## Overview

kadenfrisk.com is my personal website for showcasing everything I've made,
all my services, and all of my blog posts.

Originally this website was only for selling more websites, but as I began to
create more and more projects, I realized that I needed a place to "hub" to
connect them all. One of the biggest things I've been working on are courses
to help others learn programming. I want to help others find the resources
they need to learn programming entirely free of charge.

I will soon add more about myself here, but for now my main focus is
finishing my existing projects and creating more courses.
